# model-converter

This project aims to be a simple, lightweight, and useful 3D model editor.
For the moment, only `obj` and `ply` ascii models are supported.

# Scripts

A few utilities to manage 3D models :
  - `convert.py` that converts any type of model to any other
  - `viewer.py` which is a simple script that renders a 3d model

## Supported format
  - Wavefront `.obj`
  - Stanford `.ply`
